Start Terminal

Change the folder to project directory

Run: ./packages.sh

Then run the bash script on your system
Type: ./job.sh path_of_project_directory
Replace path_of_project_directory with path of the project directory on your system.


If ~/CoA_Project/ is your project directory, then directory structure should be the following:
- job.sh
- merge-fjc-judges <folder with scripts>
- make_dirs.py
- merge_ideology.py
- output_dir <starts empty>
- raw-caselaw <this has the raw caselaw data>
        - f-appx_text_20200604
        - f3d_text_20200604

- data-raw <raw data for merging etc>
        - ap08on.txt
        - ap71to07.txt
        - cited_from.csv.gz
        - cited_to.csv.gz
        - federal_judges_organized_by_judge.csv
        - judge_ideology.JCS.sav
        - pagerank_scores_renamed.csv

 
Please ensure that the raw data is stored in correct directory (as per the above structure). Also do not duplicate directories, for instance, the location of cited_from.csv.gz should be:

~/data-raw/cited_from.csv.gz and NOT ~/data-raw/data-raw/cited_from.csv.gz

Such mismatches will create errors.
